To make things easier on the development team, a specific structure will be used for bug reports. However, since we are not able to use a template for issue titles, we created a small list of examples for both good and bad titles for reference when creating issues.

------------

**Examples of good titles**

[Q5441] Lazy Peons - Peons do not wake up

[Q6823] Agent of Hydraxis - Duke Hydraxis missing turn in

[C3773] Akkrilus - Missing Immolate ability

[I10726] Gnomish Mind Control Cap - Effect never fails

**Examples of bad titles**

Lazy peons do not work

Agents of Hydraxis 6823 - doesn't turn in

Creature 3773 Akkrilus is missing a spell

Gnomish Mind Control Cap spell is wrong

##Issue Template

As you may have noticed if you have already hit "new issue", that we have a premade template used. This is to ensure all bug reports are well organized.

When writing your report, please ensure that you keep it clean and detailed.

Here are some examples of properly made reports

##Extra Details

In some cases, you may want to attach videos or images. You can also do this by both using github, or posting links to imgur/youtube/etc. An example is below:
